Lessons learned so far,
Import and exporting functions must be done in a specific way. 
Litterally one line is needed to export classes. 
Prompots work in a specific format const answer = await (type/inquirer.prompt). 
answer will contain the outcome of the prompt.
There is no way to mass export all functions. Damn it.
